/*
 * Due to a bug in Android Studio, this SDK's integration with dbapp-android will cause build
 * failures in Android Studio. Android Studio will complain with the following message (as of
 * Android Studio v1.5.1):
 *
 *     Unable to find module with Gradle path ':dropbox-sdk-java' (needed by module 'Dropbox'.)
 *
 * This has to do with the way Android Studio handles subprojects that contain a settings.gradle
 * file. See bug details here:
 *
 *     https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?can=2&start=0&num=100&q=&colspec=ID%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars%20Reporter%20Opened&groupby=&sort=&id=65915
 *
 * The work-around is to delete the settings.gradle file from all subprojects to get Android Studio
 * to properly detect the module. Note that building from the commandline works fine, only Android
 * Studio fails at life.
 *
 * Since this project depends on a consistent project name and is a multi-project build, we provide
 * the settings.gradle file in a non-default location and expect callers to build using:
 *
 *     $ ./gradlew -c standalone-settings.gradle
 *
