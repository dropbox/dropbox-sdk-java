 * Class for handling download requests.
 *
 * This class provides methods for downloading a request body and reading the server response.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *    FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("test.txt");
 *    try {
 *        response = downloader.download(out);
 *    } finally {
 *        out.close();
 *    }
 *</code></pre>
 *
 * Example using {@link #getInputStream}:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *    FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("test.txt");
 *    response = downloader.getResult();
 *    try {
 *        InputStream in = downloader.getInputStream();
 *        // read from in, write to out
 *    } finally {
 *        downloader.close();
 *    }
