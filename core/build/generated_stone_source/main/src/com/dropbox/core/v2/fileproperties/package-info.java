/**
 * This namespace contains helpers for property and template metadata endpoints.
 *
 * <p> These endpoints enable you to tag arbitrary key/value data to Dropbox
 * files. </p>
 *
 * <p> The most basic unit in this namespace is the {@code propertyField}. These
 * fields encapsulate the actual key/value data. </p>
 *
 * <p> Fields are added to a Dropbox file using a {@code propertyGroup}.
 * Property groups contain a reference to a Dropbox file and a {@code
 * propertyGroupTemplate}. Property groups are uniquely identified by the
 * combination of their associated Dropbox file and template. </p>
 *
 * <p> The {@code propertyGroupTemplate} is a way of restricting the possible
 * key names and value types of the data within a property group. The possible
 * key names and value types are explicitly enumerated using {@code
 * propertyFieldTemplate} objects. </p>
 *
 * <p> You can think of a property group template as a class definition for a
 * particular key/value metadata object, and the property groups themselves as
 * the instantiations of these objects. </p>
 *
 * <p> Templates are owned either by a user/app pair or team/app pair. Templates
 * and their associated properties can't be accessed by any app other than the
 * app that created them, and even then, only when the app is linked with the
 * owner of the template (either a user or team). </p>
 *
 * <p> User-owned templates are accessed via the user-auth
 * file_properties/templates/*_for_user endpoints, while team-owned templates
 * are accessed via the team-auth file_properties/templates/*_for_team
 * endpoints. Properties associated with either type of template can be accessed
 * via the user-auth properties/* endpoints. </p>
 *
 * <p> Finally, properties can be accessed from a number of endpoints that
 * return metadata, including `files/get_metadata`, and `files/list_folder`.
 * Properties can also be added during upload, using `files/upload`. </p>
 *
 * <p> See {@link
 * com.dropbox.core.v2.fileproperties.DbxTeamFilePropertiesRequests}, {@link
 * com.dropbox.core.v2.fileproperties.DbxUserFilePropertiesRequests} for a list
 * of possible requests for this namespace. </p>
